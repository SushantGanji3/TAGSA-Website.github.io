                On 10-Jan-2010, a group of 10 people met informally in the local coffee shop and the idea of starting a Telangana organization in San Antonio gave birth. A formal meeting was organized in one of the local Indian restaurants and the idea was discussed at length. After long deliberations, the group decided to open a local chapter for nationally recognized Telangana Development Forum. TDF-San Antonio chapter consisted of Vinay Basani (President), Vijay Bhasker Sureddy (Vice-President), Raghuveer Reddy Chintapalli (Secretary), Mohan Penta (Joint Secretary), Jagdeesh Gurrala (Treasurer), Srinivas Konda (Cultural Secretary);  Manohar Gayyi, Madan Puli, Vijay Gunuganti, Ram Joolukunktla, Pandu Kadire as other Executive Committee Members.
